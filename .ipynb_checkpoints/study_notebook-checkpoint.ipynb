    "- Formatting is important in instances where we want to use the values of variables is our strings to print something or to generate a customized string.\n",
    "- The following are a few ways to format strings,\n",
    "  1. *Using comma* - this is generally used when we want to format a string and use the value of the variable at the end. Python adds a space between the words when we use `comma` notation\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "        username=input(\"Please enter your name: \")\n",
    "        print(\"Hello\", username)\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "   2. *Using `str.format`* -Python 3 provides the new `format()` method that does simple positional formatting. This method formats the specified  values and inserts them inside the string's placeholders. The placeholder is defined using the curly brackets: {}\n",
    "       **Note**: This method requires that the user to take care of spaces in the text. Python will exactly use the string given as the input and replace the placeholders with values\n",
    "       - The placeholders can be identified using, named indexes `{prices}`, numbered indexes `{0}`, or even empty placeholders `{}`\n",
    "       ```\n",
    "       string_one=\"My name is {lname}, I am {age} years old\". format(lname=\"Gichuki\", age=23)\n",
    "       string_two=\"My name is {0}, I am {1} years old\". format(\"Gichuki\", 23)\n",
    "       string_three=\"My name is {}, I am {} years old\". format(\"Gichuki\", 23)\n",
    "       ```\n",
    "    3. *F-strings* - f-string is a literal string, prefixed with 'f', which contains expressions inside braces, the expressions are replaced with their values\n",
    "       - they provide a way to embed expressions inside string literals, using a minimal syntax\n",
    "       - the string itself can be formatted in much the same way that you would with `str.format()`\n",
    "       - the f-string is really an expression evaluated at runtime, not a constant values\n",
    "            ```\n",
    "            name=input(\"Enter your name:\")\n",
    "            print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n",
    "            ```\n",
    "       - this new formatting syntax is quite powerful\n",
    "       - you van even embed arbitrary expressions in the fstrings and perform various  kinds of operations\n",
    "         ```\n",
    "         num1=5\n",
    "         num2=10\n",
    "         print(f\"Five plus ten is {num1+num2}\")\n",
    "         ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concept of Index\n",
    "- A string is a sequence of characters, and an index is a numerical representation of an item's position in a sequence\n",
    "- The sequence can refer to many things: a list, a string of characters, or any arbitrary sequence of values\n",
    "- The numerical representation starts the count from 0 in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Accessing values\n",
    "- If you need to access a particular value from a string, pass the index number of the required element in square brackets\n",
    "*syntax:-*\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "      variable_name[index_number]\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Slicing\n",
    "- Slicing is extracting a part of the string from the specified index\n",
    "- just like accessing anelement, we can slice a string by using the index number\n",
    "*syntax:-*\n",
    "```\n",
    "string[start:end:step]\n",
    "```\n",
    "- slicing starts with the start index (included) and ends at the end index (excluded)\n",
    "- the step parametr is used to specify the steps to take from the start to the end index and is optional\n",
    "- if we do not pass any of the start or end values, it considers the whole string from the start to the end index respectively\n",
    "- when we pass the start and end value, it starts from the start index and stops by excluding the end index..\n",
    "\n",
    "### String operations\n",
    "1. Concatenation\n",
    "   - This is atechnique of combining 2strings, ie addition of 2 strings\n",
    "   - it can be done in two ways:-\n",
    "     * Using `+` operator\n",
    "          ```\n",
    "          fname=\"Edwin\"\n",
    "          lname=\"Gichuki\"\n",
    "          fullname=fname+\"\"+lname\n",
    "          print(fullname)\n",
    "          ```\n",
    "          - we can add an empty `string(\"\")` wherever we wish to add a whitespace\n",
    "     * Using `join()` method\n",
    "          - the `join()` method is a string method that returns a string in which the elements of a sequence have been joined together by the mentioned separator\n",
    "          - we pass the string to be combined in the `[]` in `join()` method and the mentioned separator in the `\"\"` before the `join()` method\n",
    "2. Repitition\n",
    "   - this is the process of creating new strings by concatenating multiple copies of the same string\n",
    "   - `*` operator is used to perform the string repitition\n",
    "   - in simple words it is the multiplication of string by some integer value,\n",
    "          ```\n",
    "          str=\"Python\"\n",
    "          print(str*2)\n",
    "          ```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### String methods\n",
    "- Python has a set of built-in methods that you can use with strings to perform operations and manipulate strings\n",
    "     1. `capitalize()` - converts the first character to uppercase and al the others to lowercase\n",
    "     2. `count()` - returns the number of times a specified value occurs in a string\n",
    "     3. `find()` - searches the string for a value and returns the position where it was found, if it is not found, it returns `-1`\n",
    "     4. `index()` - searches the string for a specified value and returns the position where it was found, if it is not found, it throws an exception (error)\n",
    "     5. `isalnum()` - returns True if all characters in the string are alphabetic\n",
    "     6. `isalpha()` - returns True if all characters in the string are in the alphabet\n",
    "     7. `isupper()` - returns True if all characters in the string are upper case\n",
    "     8. `islower()` - returns True if all characters in the string are lower case\n",
    "     9. `join()` - joins the elements of an iterable to the end of the string\n",
    "     10. `lower()` - converts a string into lower case\n",
    "     11. `replace(a,b)` - returns a string where a specified value is replaced with a specified value\n",
    "     12. `strip()` - returns a trimmed version of the string, ie, it removes the whitespaces from both the ends\n",
    "     13. `upper()` -converts a string into upper case\n",
    "     14. `len()` - accepts a string as a parameter and returns the length of the string, it counts all whitespaces in the string\n",
    "- ***Note***: all string methods return new values, they do not change the original string"

    "# Looping\n",
    "\n",
    "- Looping is an important concept when we need to execute a bunch of statements based on some conditions repeatedly\n",
    "- Statements are executed sequentially\n",
    "- Meaning the statement in a bloc is executed first, followed by the second, and so on.\n",
    "- There can be a situation where we need to execute a block of code several number of times\n",
    "- A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or a group of statements multiple times\n",
    "- **Repetitive** execution of the same block of code over and over is reffered to as iteration\n",
    "- There are two types of iteration,\n",
    "    1. **Definite iteration**, in which the number of repititions is specified explicitly in advance\n",
    "    2. **Indefinite iteration**, in which the code block executes until some condition is met\n",
    "- Python provides various loops to handle theiterations, namely,\n",
    "    1. **For loop** - it is generally used for definite iteration\n",
    "    2. **While loop** - it is generally used for indefinite iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "## **range()**\n",
    "- The range() is a built-in function that is used when a user needs to perform an action for a specific number of times\n",
    "- It is used to generate a sequence of numbers and is commonly used with the for loop ie. `range` allows the user to generate a seriesof numbers within a given range\n",
    "- Depending on how many arguments are passed to the range function, we can decide where the series of numbers will begin and end as well as what the step size will be between a number and the next\n",
    "- The function mainly takes 3 arguments:\n",
    "    1. **start**: an integer starting from which the series of integers is to be returned\n",
    "    2. **stop**: an integer before which the series of integers is to be returned, the range of integers ends at stop -1\n",
    "    3. **step (optional)**: an integer value that determines the increment between each integer in the sequence\n",
    "\n",
    "## **for loop**\n",
    "- for loop is used for sequential traversal\n",
    "- it has ability to iterate over the items of any sequence, such as a list or string\n",

    "- it will start from 0 and run till range-1 because the stop value in a range function is excluded\n",

    "## while loop\n",

    "\n",
    "## Break statement\n",
    "- The break statement is used to terminate the loop statement in which it is present, the control then passes to the staements that are present after the loop block ends\n",
    "- The break statement is important where a condition arises and you want to exit the loop completely before the end condition arrives, it changes the execution from its normal sequence\n",

    "# Read-Only Lists: Tuples\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tuples are similar to the lists. Lists allow us to store multiple values in a single variable\n",
    "+ The only major difference is that values of lists can be changed, ie, Lists are mutable, whereas Tuples are immutable, ie, values of Tuples cannot be changed\n",
    "+ Tuples are used in situations where we may wish to restrict the manipulation of sequences of values\n",
    "+ We can only fetch and read the values\n",
    "+ Tuples is a data type/structure in Python, they come under the category of sequence data types\n",
    "+ Here are some important features of tuples\n",
    "    * Tuples are ordered collections of multiple values\n",
    "    * Tuples are immutable\n",
    "    * Tuples allow us to store duplicate values\n",
    "\n",
    "#### creating a tuple\n",
    "+ Tuples are created by just placing the sequence inside the `paranthesis ()`\n",
    "+ The elements inside the parentheses are comma separated\n",
    "+ it can have any number of items and they may be of different types (integer, float, string, etc...)\n",
    "+ Example\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    tuple1=()\n",
    "    tuple2=(1,4,6,8,9)\n",
    "    tuple3=(\"Gichuki\", 23.5, 56, False)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### manipulating tuples\n",
    "+ the following are ways to manipulate tuples\n",
    "    1. Accessing elements of a tuple\n",
    "    2. Tuple slicing\n",
    "    3. Updating a tuple (Spoiler alert: this is not possible)\n",
    "    4. Deleting elements of a tuple\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Accessing elements and tuple slicing - tuples are a sequence data type, thus each element is associated with an index that starts from zero.\n",
    "+ Just like lists, we can use indexes to access and slice elements of a tuple.\n",
    "+ Updating tuples - tuples are immutable, thus we cannot update tuples.\n",
    "+ the code below will raise an error since tuples are immutable:\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    tuple1 = (1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7)\n",
    "    tuple1[3] = 9\n",
    "    print(tuple1)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "**Output**\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Since tuples are immutable, deleting/removing individual tuple elements isn't possible\n",
    "+ However, you can delete the entire tuple using the `del` keyword\n",
    "\n",
    "#### operations on tuples\n",
    "+ All the basinc operations performed on a list can be performed on tuples as well\n",
    "+ However, the result of the operation is always a new tuple since we cannot manipulate the existing tuple\n",
    "+ operations,\n",
    "    1. concatenation\n",
    "    2. repitition\n",
    "    3. membership\n",
    "\n",
    "#### built-in functions for tuples\n",
    "* len(tuple) - returns the length of the tuples\n",
    "* min(tuple) - returns the elements of the tuples with the minimum value\n",
    "* max(tuple) - returns the elements of the tuples with the maximum value\n",
    "+ since tuples are immutable, we cannot use methods such as, `append(), insert(), remove(), pop(), etc` which manipulate and modify the sequence\n",
    "\n",
    "+ There are 2 methods that we can use on tuples\n",
    "    1. `index(element)`: returns the index of the first matched item\n",
    "    2. `count(element)`: returns the number of times an element occurs in the sequence\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### advantages of tuples\n",
    "1. we generally use tuples for heterogeneous (different) data types and lists for homogeneous (similar) data types\n",
    "2. since tuples are immutable, iterating over them is faster than iterating over a list, so there is a slight performance boost\n",
    "3. tuples that contain immutable elements can be used as a key for a dictionary, with lists, that is not possible\n",
    "4. if you have data that does not change, implementing it as a tuple will guarantee that it remains write-protected\n"
