    "## String Formatting\n",
    "- Formatting is important in instances where we want to use the values of variables is our strings to print something or to generate a customized string.\n",
    "- The following are a few ways to format strings,\n",
    "  1. *Using comma* - this is generally used when we want to format a string and use the value of the variable at the end. Python adds a space between the words when we use `comma` notation\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "        username=input(\"Please enter your name: \")\n",
    "        print(\"Hello\", username)\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "   2. *Using `str.format`* -Python 3 provides the new `format()` method that does simple positional formatting. This method formats the specified  values and inserts them inside the string's placeholders. The placeholder is defined using the curly brackets: {}\n",
    "       **Note**: This method requires that the user to take care of spaces in the text. Python will exactly use the string given as the input and replace the placeholders with values\n",
    "       - The placeholders can be identified using, named indexes `{prices}`, numbered indexes `{0}`, or even empty placeholders `{}`\n",
    "       ```\n",
    "       string_one=\"My name is {lname}, I am {age} years old\". format(lname=\"Gichuki\", age=23)\n",
    "       string_two=\"My name is {0}, I am {1} years old\". format(\"Gichuki\", 23)\n",
    "       string_three=\"My name is {}, I am {} years old\". format(\"Gichuki\", 23)\n",
    "       ```\n",
    "    3. *F-strings* - f-string is a literal string, prefixed with 'f', which contains expressions inside braces, the expressions are replaced with their values\n",
    "       - they provide a way to embed expressions inside string literals, using a minimal syntax\n",
    "       - the string itself can be formatted in much the same way that you would with `str.format()`\n",
    "       - the f-string is really an expression evaluated at runtime, not a constant values\n",
    "            ```\n",
    "            name=input(\"Enter your name:\")\n",
    "            print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n",
    "            ```\n",
    "       - this new formatting syntax is quite powerful\n",
    "       - you van even embed arbitrary expressions in the fstrings and perform various  kinds of operations\n",
    "         ```\n",
    "         num1=5\n",
    "         num2=10\n",
    "         print(f\"Five plus ten is {num1+num2}\")\n",
    "         ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concept of Index\n",
    "- A string is a sequence of characters, and an index is a numerical representation of an item's position in a sequence\n",
    "- The sequence can refer to many things: a list, a string of characters, or any arbitrary sequence of values\n",
    "- The numerical representation starts the count from 0 in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Accessing values\n",
    "- If you need to access a particular value from a string, pass the index number of the required element in square brackets\n",
    "*syntax:-*\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "      variable_name[index_number]\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Slicing\n",
    "- Slicing is extracting a part of the string from the specified index\n",
    "- just like accessing anelement, we can slice a string by using the index number\n",
    "*syntax:-*\n",
    "```\n",
    "string[start:end:step]\n",
    "```\n",
    "- slicing starts with the start index (included) and ends at the end index (excluded)\n",
    "- the step parametr is used to specify the steps to take from the start to the end index and is optional\n",
    "- if we do not pass any of the start or end values, it considers the whole string from the start to the end index respectively\n",
    "- when we pass the start and end value, it starts from the start index and stops by excluding the end index..\n",
    "\n",
    "### String operations\n",
    "1. Concatenation\n",
    "   - This is atechnique of combining 2strings, ie addition of 2 strings\n",
    "   - it can be done in two ways:-\n",
    "     * Using `+` operator\n",
    "          ```\n",
    "          fname=\"Edwin\"\n",
    "          lname=\"Gichuki\"\n",
    "          fullname=fname+\"\"+lname\n",
    "          print(fullname)\n",
    "          ```\n",
    "          - we can add an empty `string(\"\")` wherever we wish to add a whitespace\n",
    "     * Using `join()` method\n",
    "          - the `join()` method is a string method that returns a string in which the elements of a sequence have been joined together by the mentioned separator\n",
    "          - we pass the string to be combined in the `[]` in `join()` method and the mentioned separator in the `\"\"` before the `join()` method\n",
    "2. Repitition\n",
    "   - this is the process of creating new strings by concatenating multiple copies of the same string\n",
    "   - `*` operator is used to perform the string repitition\n",
    "   - in simple words it is the multiplication of string by some integer value,\n",
    "          ```\n",
    "          str=\"Python\"\n",
    "          print(str*2)\n",
    "          ```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### String methods\n",
    "- Python has a set of built-in methods that you can use with strings to perform operations and manipulate strings\n",
    "     1. `capitalize()` - converts the first character to uppercase and al the others to lowercase\n",
    "     2. `count()` - returns the number of times a specified value occurs in a string\n",
    "     3. `find()` - searches the string for a value and returns the position where it was found, if it is not found, it returns `-1`\n",
    "     4. `index()` - searches the string for a specified value and returns the position where it was found, if it is not found, it throws an exception (error)\n",
    "     5. `isalnum()` - returns True if all characters in the string are alphabetic\n",
    "     6. `isalpha()` - returns True if all characters in the string are in the alphabet\n",
    "     7. `isupper()` - returns True if all characters in the string are upper case\n",
    "     8. `islower()` - returns True if all characters in the string are lower case\n",
    "     9. `join()` - joins the elements of an iterable to the end of the string\n",
    "     10. `lower()` - converts a string into lower case\n",
    "     11. `replace(a,b)` - returns a string where a specified value is replaced with a specified value\n",
    "     12. `strip()` - returns a trimmed version of the string, ie, it removes the whitespaces from both the ends\n",
    "     13. `upper()` -converts a string into upper case\n",
    "     14. `len()` - accepts a string as a parameter and returns the length of the string, it counts all whitespaces in the string\n",
    "- ***Note***: all string methods return new values, they do not change the original string"
